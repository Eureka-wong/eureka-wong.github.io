My name is Yunya Wang, a second-year student majoring in Data Science at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, currently embarking on my journey into the realm of scientific research. I now take an active part in Multimodal Research Group led by [Butian Xiong](https://saliteta.github.io/), guided by Professor [ZhenLi](https://mypage.cuhk.edu.cn/academics/lizhen/). Our research focuses on 3D representations. Though still exploring my academic interests, I am passionate about learning and curious about the unknown. I look forward to acquiring new knowledge, honing skills, and contributing to innovative research endeavors.
